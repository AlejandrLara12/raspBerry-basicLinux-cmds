tee

	when we try to save the output of a cmd we use '>'

	ls <dirName> > outputResult.txt
	
	when we use '>', we can't see the output, and we can only save 
	it into one file


	ls <dirName> |tee fileOne.txt dirName/fileTwo.txt

	here we have creted a 'tee', and we can see the output in the
	cmd line and will also create/save that output into fileOne
	and into fileTwo as well
